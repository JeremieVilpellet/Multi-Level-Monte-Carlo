### Multi Level Monte Carlo 

""" All results are based on the notebook are based on the paper in this repo """
""" Project made alone """

In this project, we present the classical Monte Carlo method and discuss its principles and limitations. 

We then introduce the Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) method, which improves the accuracy and efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations. 

MLMC achieves this by leveraging simulations at different levels of discretization of the SDE and efficiently combining the results. 

This approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining the desired level of precision.
